## Hi there 👋

I'm **Lucas**, a **Software Engineering** student currently on my **2nd year of University**.

I like to build anything that I randomly think of. Ranging from simple tools to use or small games.

### 🎮 Game Development
I create arcade retro-style games using **Pico-8**.
You can find them on my [Itchio](https://lethaldawg.itch.io) page or here on [GitHub](https://github.com/LucasAlexandrou/Pico-8-Games-Collection)
